# Burse_Train:
first run the produceBurse.py and send your selling and buying request besides some information to the server.
then you can run multiple consumerBurse.py and tell each of them that which of your queues you want to start processing.
in previous step you should tell sth like this : customer/seller_name of your stock e.g. ---> seller_s1.
you can see the stock information in the SellStockInfo.txt
enjoy :)
